Collection of pyspark scripts

This repository is a place where I share my scripts created while learning Spark, within the Hortonworks Sandbox.

<h4>US Congress Members</h4>
It explores a bit the data compiled by the website FiveThirtyEight, related to the members of US Congress, from 1947 to 2014. I used PySpark SQL. The <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-age">source link</a>.

With the International football results dataset, compiled by Mart JÃ¼risoo, I explored some of the metrics of the Scottish National Team. For the moment, I am not taking into consideration the shootouts data, however, the file is also included in the source files folder.
